# SteamLibraryManager

Please don't judge this too harshly, it's been a testbed to learn C++. It's not completely functional, and has more cons than pros, but hopefully it illustrates that I can write some form of functional C++.

The purpose of this tool is to list Steam libraries and games, their file sizes, their locations on disk, and to be able to transfer games between libraries
It is in a seemingly perpeptual state of WIP.
