Required functionality:
- build a list of all library games

Resources:
- A folder full of app manifest files
- A folder full of games folders

which should I use?
- app manifest
- game folders
- both (hybrid?)

what do I want to do:
- move game folders from library to library

why?
- to free up space

answer:
- I want to see every folder in the library
- Folders should be discovered via the folders, and populated via the manifest

- Todo:
- Create a "Game" object
    - It pulls info from the manifest, if available, and from the folder directly if not.
- The library will create these game objects with a libraryfolder object, a steamapps directory path, and an app manifest (if available).
